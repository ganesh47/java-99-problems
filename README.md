# 99 Problems in Java

[![Build](https://github.com/ganesh47/java-99-problems/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ganesh47/java-99-problems/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is my attempt at solving the famous "99 Problems" collection in Java. These problems were originally designed for Prolog and later adapted for Lisp, but solving them in Java provides an interesting perspective on functional programming concepts in a primarily object-oriented language.

## About the Problems
The problems involve working with:
- Lists
- Arithmetic
- Logic and Codes
- Binary Trees
- Multiway Trees
- Graphs
- Miscellaneous Problems

Each solution demonstrates Java's capabilities while staying true to the spirit of the original problems. Where possible, solutions utilize modern Java features and functional programming concepts.

## Project Structure
- Each problem is implemented as a separate class with corresponding unit tests
- Solutions are documented with problem descriptions and example usage
- Test coverage ensures reliability anAd correctness

## Code Coverage
Latest coverage report is available in the [most recent successful workflow run](https://github.com/ganesh47/java-99-problems/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Amain+is%3Asuccess) under Artifacts â†’ coverage-report
